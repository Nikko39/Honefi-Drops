## ðŸ‘‹ Honefi proposal on WAX LABS

This repository contains information regarding the development of the [HoneFi platform](https://honefi.app), including a roadmap, which is specified in the [proposal](https://labs.wax.io/proposals/81), as well as reports on deliverables. The reports are published with a description of the work done, as well as technical details if the deliverables contain development of any functionality.

For convenient activity monitoring, we have made a navigation of all currently started and completed tasks, which is shown below.

## ðŸ“œ List of Deliverables

1. [Auction Platform]().
2. [LaunchPool Platform]().
3. [Backend Development]().
4. [Final Stage]().


###  Auction Platform

The Auction Platform is a tool for two types of auctions (balance and Dutch) that works with both NFTs and tokens. The development is divided into several stages:
- [x] Creating UI/UX in a modern style
- [x] Frontend development for NFT's auctions and tokens sections
- [x] Development of smart contracts for each type of auction (NFT and tokens)
- [x] Developing an auction dashboard

#### UI/UX

#### Frontend development for NFT's auctions and tokens sections

We have developed Frontend for all the necessary functionality related to creating and participating in auctions. You can use https://honefi.app to test the full functionality. The main tasks performed:
- Connecting authentication for WAX cloud wallet and anchor
- Auction creation page - https://honefi.app/create
- Current NFT auctions page (and filter) - https://honefi.app/drops
- Current Tokens auctions page (and filter) - https://honefi.app/tokens
- Auction pages containing purchase, settings, auction information and all social media

#### Development of smart contracts for each type of auction (NFT and tokens)

#### Developing an auction dashboard

To create auctions, we made a management page, which is available after connecting the wallet to the site - https://honefi.app/create

Creation takes place in several stages:
- Select the desired collection and add auth to the collection (approve)
- Go to collection management (the "Manage" button) and get available functions, which include - NFT drop page, Token drop page, top up RAM balance for the collection
- When you go to one of the drop management pages, you can either create a new dropbox or go to an existing one.
- To create a new drop, you need to fill in all the fields on the page - the name, description, price changes in % and minutes, add a cover and specify the start time of the auction, as well as its duration
- In the next step, you can check how your drop will look after creation. If everything is filled in correctly, you can create the drop

###  LaunchPool Platform

LaunchPool is a tool for fast and comprehensive project token launches on the HoneFi platform. The development is divided into several stages:
- [x] Creating UI/UX in a modern style
- [x] Frontend development for LaunchPool
- [x] Development of smart contracts for LaunchPool
- [x] Developing an Backend for data storage

#### UI/UX

#### Frontend development for LaunchPool

We've developed a frontend for all the core features of the Launchpool, including the following features:
- Connecting authentication for WAX cloud wallet and anchor
- LaunchPool Main page - https://honefi.app/launchpad
- Different types of LaunchPool cards appearance and filtering
- Current LaunchPool auctions page - https://honefi.app/launchpool/48
- Several blocks for each stage of LauchPool - preparation, staking, claiming, completed

The LaunchPool platform allows you to create lunchpools for projects approved by one of the trusted sources on the WAX blockchain. The process for participating in a LaunchPool is as follows:

- LaunchPools are divided into 3 active stages (preperation, staking, claim)
- The preperation stage is the project preparation stage, which takes a week or more to announce the LaunchPool launch and conduct all necessary activities.
- The staking stage allows users to lock any number of WAXP assets to get a guaranteed share/allocation.
- The claim stage recalculates the correct shares for each user who participated in LaunchPool and allows you to unlock your WAXP assets (minus the share buyback)

#### Development of smart contracts for LaunchPool

HoneFi Main Smart Contract - **honefidropsx**

The source code of the smart contract is uploaded to this repository and can be viewed [here](links)

Technical details:

>**createpool** - administrative function for creating LaunchPool.

| Field Name  | Type  | Description |
|---|---|---|
| contract_adress  | name | Token Contract |
| supply  | asset  | Supply for Pool |
| price | asset | Price for Token |
| deposit  | asset | Deposit Function |
| token_decimals  | int32  | Token Decimals |
| start | uint64 | UNIX Start Time |
| end_  | uint64 | UNIX End Time |
| token_decimals  | int32  | Token Decimals |
| token_ticker | string | Token Ticker |

>**stakelaunch** - action to participate in the staking of a specific LaunchPool.

| Field Name  | Type  | Description |
|---|---|---|
| username  | name | WAX Wallet |
| dropnum  | int32  | ID of LaunchPool |
| quantity | asset | Quantity to Stake |

>**claimlaunch** - action to claim WAXP and project tokens.

| Field Name  | Type  | Description |
|---|---|---|
| username  | name | WAX Wallet |

>**claimwax** - action to claim WAXP for the creator.

| Field Name  | Type  | Description |
|---|---|---|
| username  | name | WAX Wallet |
| dropnum  | int32  | ID of LaunchPool |
#### Developing an Backend for data storage

We have developed a handy backend for the HoneFi platform to store a lot of information about current drops. The main advantage:

- Storing large additional project descriptions.
- Storing static files that are only used on the drop page.
- Faster and more stable price retrieval.

Our backend is available at https://api.honefi.app. We use several arguments for LaunchPool - price/ID and /launchpool/ID
